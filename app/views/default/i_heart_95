<h1>I Heart I-95</h1>
<br>
<br>

I <%= params[:verb1]%> on I-95 every day for my commute, and today traffic is <%= params[:adjective1]%> .  I am not surprised, because this, after all, Florida, home of accidents on the <%= params[:adjective2]%> side of the <%=params[:noun1]%> and we are still stopped. <br><br> Auston will be <%=params[:adjective3]%> because I won’t be in class, coding away in my favorite <%=params[:noun2]%>, Ruby.  If only it were Friday and we had a Retro, I could look forward to <%=params[:noun3]%>, but now I won’t even get to see Gabe and his <%=params[:adjective4]%> morning face. With traffic moving this <%=params[:adverb1]%>, it would be faster to take a <%=params[:noun4]%> to class.
