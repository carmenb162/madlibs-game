<!-- “I #{params[:verb1]} on I-95 every day for my commute, and today traffic is #{params[:adjective1]} .  I am not surprised, because this, after all, Florida, home of accidents on the #{params[:adjective2]} side of the #{params[:noun1]} and we are still stopped.

Auston will be #{params[:adjective3]} because I won’t be in class, coding away in my favorite #{params[:noun2]}, Ruby.  If only it were Friday and we had a Retro, I could look forward to #{params[:noun3]}, but now I won’t even get to see Gabe and his #{params[:adjective4]} morning face. With traffic moving this #{params[:adparams[:verb1]]}, it would be faster to take a #{params[:noun4]} to class.” -->
